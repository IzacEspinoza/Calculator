//Basic functins of calculator
//additon
const add = (a, b) => {return a + b;}
//subtraction
const subtract = (a, b) => {return a - b};
//multiplication
const multiply = (a, b) => {return a * b;}
//division
const divide = (a, b) => {return a / b;}

//Calculation function
//Take in two numbers and an operation, then call from above(depending on the operator used)
const calculate = (num1, operator, num2) => {
    //first see what operator was used(+, *, - etc)
    //then call a function from above with parameters plugged in based on what operation they chose
};
